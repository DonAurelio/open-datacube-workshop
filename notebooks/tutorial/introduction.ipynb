    "About 710 Earth Observation satellites are orbiting the Earth. \"The satellites collect about 1,200 scenes (images) that take up about 1 terabyte of data every day\". The **Open Datacube (ODC)** initiative tackles the problem of organize, query and retrieve massive spatio-temporal data in a homogeneous way. We can then, query a satellite image like in the example depicted bellow:\n",

    "Remote sensing is the process of collecting data about the earth's surface without being in contact with it [1]. Remote sensing systems measure earth's reflected energy and process this information into a raster image.\n",
    "Reflected energy is commonly called the earth's spectral response or reflectance. This spectral response is split by multi-spectral sensors according with the wavelength into different bands [2]. Bands capture certain land properties that can be observed after a proper image processing. Satellite images provide information in, at least, four dimensions: latitude, longitude, time, and spectral [3]. Being latitude and longitude the geospatial location of every pixel or cell in the raster image, time the date on which the image was collected and spectral dimension the one that contains information about reflected energy. Image processing techniques are applied on images to develop thematic maps of land-use and land-cover essential in many remote sensing applications like forestry, agriculture, environmental studies, weather forecasting, ocean studies, archaeological studies, etc [1].\n",
